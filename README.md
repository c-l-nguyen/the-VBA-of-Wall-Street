Excel VBA scripting on stock market data.

This project uses VBA scripting in Excel to summarize sample stock market data according to three different levels:

1. Easy - Returns the following using Easy(), EasyChallenge() macros: 
    * stock ticker symbol
    * total stock volume per ticker

2. Moderate - Returns the following using Moderate(), ModerateChallenge() macros: 
    * stock ticker symbol
    * yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
    * percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
    * total stock volume per ticker
\
    *NOTE*: if any stock contains opening price of 0, then the percent change is defaulted to NULL value in the corresponding sumamry cell since we cannot divide by 0

3. Hard - Returns the following using Hard(), HardChallenge() macros:
    * Contains everything from the moderate level
    * stock with "Greatest % increase"
    * stock with "Greatest % decrease"
    * stock with "Greatest total volume"

Also note that there are "Clear`[SolutionLevel`]()" macros included to easily clear out cells and formatting for a clean re-run of VBA summary scripts if needed.

The *Challenge() macros loop through each sheet in the Excel workbook and applies the solution to every sheet.
